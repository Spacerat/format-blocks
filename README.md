# Format Blocks

Format Blocks is a library for building code formatters.

This will be published on PyPi once I'm reasonably happy with the tests and have some CI going.

## Origins

Format Blocks is a fork of the guts of Google's R Formatter, [rfmt](https://github.com/google/rfmt).
Rfmt was written as a formatting library with an R implementation, _almost_ entirely decoupled. To
create Format Blocks, I just did some final decoupling, then polished up the code and wrote some
extra features and tests.
